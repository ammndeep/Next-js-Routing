# Routing in Next.js

Next.js provides a powerful and flexible routing system that allows you to easily navigate between pages in your web application. In this project, we'll explore both simple routing and dynamic routing.

## Simple Routing

### Getting Started

To create a new Route in Next.js, you can simply create a new folder in the `app` directory. The folder name becomes the route path.

`Example :`

Folder Name : `about`

Inside `about` folder another folder is `aboutcollege`


```
The Route is

localhost:3000/about/aboutcollege
 ```
